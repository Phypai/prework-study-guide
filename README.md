## Description

My motivation is to learn a skill set that is in high demand as well as something I am passionate about. I would also like to earn a good salary every year to maintain the lifestyle of my choosing. I built the project because I want to begin learning code. It solved my fear of possibly not being able to code. I learned how to use a terminal, at least a very small portion of it. I am super excited to begin my new career in 6 months! I can't wait to really be able to start my life and nothing will stop me!

Step 1: Get through Coding Bootcamp.
Step 2: Get career as a coder.
Step 3: Further my knowledge in coding.
